# Text Generation with Transformers: A PyTorch Implementation

This repository contains the code for a text generation project using Transformer architecture implemented in PyTorch. The project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of Transformers in generating coherent and contextually relevant text.

## Project Overview

In this project, we leverage state-of-the-art Transformer architecture to develop a streamlined pipeline for text generation. We implement a simplified yet efficient training process, training the model for 100 epochs with a learning rate of 0.001. By the end of training, our model achieves a low loss of 0.027, indicative of its high performance in minimizing errors and discrepancies.

## Features

- Utilization of Transformer architecture for enhanced text generation capabilities.
- Implementation of a simplified training pipeline for efficient model optimization.
- Successful demonstration of inference results closely resembling the training data, highlighting the model's accuracy and effectiveness.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the provided scripts to train the model and generate text.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is [Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11) by Lewis Carroll. This classic text serves as the basis for training our text generation model.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of a decoder-only Transformer model, which effectively captures long-range dependencies in text. We employ PyTorch to implement the model architecture and optimize it for text generation tasks.

## Results

By training our model for 100 epochs, we achieve impressive results in generating text that closely resembles the training data. The model demonstrates proficiency in capturing complex linguistic patterns and producing coherent text outputs.

## Future Directions

In future iterations of the project, we aim to explore advanced techniques such as fine-tuning pre-trained Transformer models and experimenting with different datasets to further improve text generation performance.
